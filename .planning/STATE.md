## Project Reference

- **Core value**: executable engine of the full three-layer-stack methodology — orchestration brain + prompt library, machine-codifying CLAUDE.md collaboration rules into a subagent-isolated routing engine. Does NOT vendor upstream code; composes + arbitrates heterogeneous upstreams (gstack/ECC/GSD/superpowers/…).
- **Current focus**: **No active milestone. Latest npm 4.11.3** (cosmetic: HARNESSED ASCII wordmark + parrot tagline atop `harnessed setup`, above the version banner). Prior 4.11.2 = design-taste-frontend install fix ( it's a taste-skill **v2 PromptScript** skill that rejects `--global` + the full-URL form hung to the 300s timeout — manifest now uses `owner/repo` shorthand + `--skill design-taste-frontend --copy` (no `--global`, ~4s); `npx-skill-installer` flag guard relaxed `--global`→optional. Whole-pack `add <url>` skips the PromptScript v2, so `--skill` is required). Prior: 4.11.1 setup robustness (state.json race + version banner); 4.11.0 design swap (frontend-design → design-taste-frontend taste-skill, two-stage); 4.10.1 installer force-update robustness; v12.0 Forward Continuation 4.10.0. **Process lessons**: (1) a 300s install spawn-timeout isn't always slow network — run the real command to get the true error (here a PromptScript `--global` rejection that errors in 4s via shorthand but hangs via full-URL); (2) local vitest can't run the `setup.test.ts` family (orphan-MCP-proc) → CI is the authoritative gate; extract a heavily-`vi.mock`'d addition into its own module.
- **Latest shipped (npm)**: **v4.10.1** 2026-06-30 (npm `harnessed@4.10.1` latest + GitHub release `v4.10.1` non-draft, CI `074baa1` 3-OS green, provenance) — patch: `harnessed setup` force-update robustness (a real install surfaced 6/14 already-installed components failing the optional force-update). Learned comet's idempotent + fail-soft installer: **Fix A** 3 git-clone manifests `rm -rf <dest>` before write (re-runnable) · **Fix B** install timeout 120→300s (npx cold-fetch) · **Fix C** force-update refresh-failure of a still-present component → `kept-existing` warn (presence-probed), not red `failed` — absorbs upstream drift (gsd verify). 9 TDD tests. Prior 4.10.0 = v12.0 Forward Continuation + issue #2; 4.9.1 = issue #1; 4.9.0 = v11.0. Detail: CHANGELOG `## [4.10.1]`.

## Current Position

- **v12.0 Forward Continuation SHIPPED + PUBLISHED npm 4.10.0 2026-06-30** (minor; bundled the issue #2 fix). Closes the horizontal-advance gap: after a task/phase finishes, derive + advance to the next (cross-task/phase), vs manual re-invocation. Full release flow: push main → 3-OS CI green (`28406331261`) → tag `v4.10.0` → publish.yml `npm publish --provenance` + `gh release` (`28406547619` success). Verified npm latest=**4.10.0** + gh release `v4.10.0` non-draft. Design = 5-repo fusion (gsd-pi/gsd-core/Trellis/comet/oh-my-pi), spec `.planning/specs/2026-06-30-forward-continuation-design.md`. `/office-hours` transparent-skipped (direction pre-locked). **Installed users re-run `harnessed setup`.** **Next: no active milestone.**
- **Post-release follow-ups (deferred, non-blocking)**: harnessed-site `reference/cli.md` next/advance docs (en+zh) · 9 localized READMEs backfill (vs-native + three-layer-stack) · optional D5 `gsd_run` reuse · task-level CLI surface (resolver-ready). v12.0 milestone can be lightweight-closed (ROADMAP row added; phase dirs 37–40 stay in `phases/`).
- **Phases (waves, spec §7)**: P37 W1 `deriveNext.ts` + `planningScan.ts` (pure core + TDD) · P38 W2 `harnessed next` exit-codes + `harnessed advance` + advance-gate · P39 W3 per-turn current→next pointer + optional `gsd_run` reuse · P40 W4 docs + verify. **P37 ✅ deriveNext.ts + planningScan.ts (13 tests) · P38 ✅ forwardStep.ts + `harnessed next` exit-codes + `harnessed advance` + gate · P39 ✅ per-turn NEXT-UNIT (ts↔bin parity, D5 gsd_run deferred) · P40 ✅ verify (full gate green) + CHANGELOG Unreleased; site CLI docs + README marketing ride the release.** **v12.0 core BUILT + GREEN local, npm UNPUBLISHED** — full gate: vitest 1673/0 · tsc 0 · biome · skill+yaml-i18n-parity · workflow-schema. Phase-level advance is the shipped floor (OQ-2); task-level resolver-ready, CLI-unwired. Target npm 4.10.0 (minor) — release pending user decision (would bundle issue #2 fix too, currently pushed-not-released at npm 4.9.1).
- **OQ locks (2026-06-30, discuss-phase)**: OQ-1 = `advance` **print-only** (no auto-seed; main session runs the next `/auto`). OQ-2 = **phase-level advance is the floor**; task-level checkbox iteration is optional stretch. OQ-3 = **`phases/NN-*/` dir scan is the primary active-phase SoT** (completion = PLAN has matching SUMMARY, artifact-derived, naturally skips shipped) + a lightweight ROADMAP active-phases section for not-yet-created phases.
- **Pushed-not-released**: issue #2 fix + 三层栈 messaging (commits `eaab2b4`..`5f31366`) on remote, 3-OS CI green (`28387027720`), but **npm still 4.9.1** (no tag). Release 4.9.2 deferred (user choosing forward-continuation first). Localization (9 README vs-native + three-layer-stack) deferred.

## Accumulated Context

### Invariants (must not break)

- en-default byte-identical; claude default install byte-identical; additive-only (no en-behavior mutation).
- KARPATHY-minimal surgical diffs; full gate green vs the 1394-test baseline; Windows CI green on 3 platforms.
- Biome preempt before every TS/JS commit (`pnpm exec biome check --write`).
- Every `.planning/` edit self-exemplifies doc-discipline (STATE digest <100 lines; overview pointers not inlined narrative).
- NEVER push to remote without explicit user approval.

### Open todos / carry-forward (non-blocking, from v9.0)

- v9.0 perf follow-on (`detectPlatform` step-3 pin `readFileSync` per-call throw-catch), `migrateLegacyHarnessedRoot` not descriptor-routed, residual `~/.claude` hardcodes (check-*/uninstallers/harnessedRoot legacy-migration), doc-hygiene (shipped phase dirs 09–28 stay in active `phases/`). Detail: prior STATE git history + `milestones/v9.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`. Address when touched / a fuller archive pass is wanted.
- **Uncommitted (pre-existing, not this milestone)**: `README.md` — intentional 2-line removal (comparison-doc pointer); leave for user.
- **Untracked noise (never add)**: `.understand-anything/`, `AGENTS.md`, `phases/_rogue-impl-reference/`.

## Session Continuity

- **issue #2 fixed (local, npm UNPUBLISHED) 2026-06-29**: `/auto` etc. injected the philosophy-layer `SKILL.md` whose "How to invoke" was a cross-file pointer to `commands/<name>.md` → agent freestyled, bypassing the engine (no `gates`/`checkpoint`/ledger/evidence-guard). 5-repo research (comet/oh-my-pi/gsd-pi/Trellis/gsd-core) → consensus: the injected artifact itself must carry executable steps + bypass must fail at the engine/per-turn layer; cross-harness (Codex ⊅ `@import`) → inline TEXT not `@import`. Fix = **T1** inline the deterministic state-machine into all 52 SKILL invoke sections (+ anti-freestyle directive + Trellis-style positive-invariant test; marker→`v4.9.3`) + **T2** per-turn `ENGINE:` enforcement line in the `<workflow-state>` breadcrumb (`injectState.ts` + `bin/harnessed-inject-state.mjs` parity). Also **promoted `ship` to orchestrator** (a documented stage-master but missing `role-prompts.yaml` entry → `commands/ship.md` never generated + misclassified execution; added ship/ship-preflight entries + `ORCHESTRATOR_COMMANDS`/`nameToYamlHintPath`). + README `🆚 vs Native Claude Code / Codex` table. Commits `eaab2b4`(T1+ship)/`aa199a3`(T2)/`d384863`(README) on main, NOT pushed. Local gate green (tsc 0 / vitest 1641 / biome / skill+yaml-i18n-parity / workflow-schema); 3-OS CI not yet run. Installed users need `harnessed setup` re-copy. **Release pending user decision (would be 4.9.2).**
- **issue #1 fixed + PUBLISHED npm 4.9.1 2026-06-26**: `/auto` via SKILL.md drove the deprecated `harnessed run` (nested SDK spawn → silent no-op + 108s hang inside CC). Root cause = v4.0 migration updated `commands/<name>.md` to CC-native but left 48 `SKILL.md` invoke sections on `harnessed run`. Fix = footgun-anchored rewrite of all 48 SKILL files to CC-native (+ `skill-invoke-parity` anti-drift test) + `harnessed run` runtime hardening (defaultSpawnDriver fail-fast on sub failure / nested-CC guard via Phase 35 `sessionIdEnv` seam / non-interactive readline guard). vitest 1535 pass 0 fail. Released as patch: commits `953c134`/`fcb19cc`(i18n-parity regression fix)/`14dab93`(bump), tag `v4.9.1`, npm latest=4.9.1 + gh release non-draft. **Installed users need `harnessed setup` re-copy** for the SKILL fix to take effect. Lesson: ran the CI hard-fail gate scripts (`scripts/check-*.mjs`) only after a red CI — see [[feedback_ci-gate-scripts-preflight]].
- **v11.0 SHIPPED + PUBLISHED npm 4.9.0 2026-06-26** (CEO review → SHIP; full flow push→CI 3-OS green→tag `v4.9.0`→publish.yml npm-publish+gh-release; verified npm latest=4.9.0 + gh release non-draft). Closed lightweight (audit 4/4); the v5.0 state-machine arc fully delivered. **No active milestone — next direction TBD.** When starting one: strategy gate (`/office-hours` + `/plan-ceo-review`) applies for a genuinely new direction (skip only if pre-defined like v11.0 was). Baseline 1470 tests. Per 逐-gate + NEVER push without explicit user approval.
- **Methodology lesson (still active)**: GSD plan-phase agent chain overreaches on this host — drive plan+execute hand-controlled in the main session. GSD `context: fork` slash skills fire-and-die — spawn `gsd-planner`/`gsd-executor` via Agent tool if needed; self-verify subagent outputs (grep files / run green gate), don't trust swallowed final text. Always produce PWF 三件套 (task_plan/progress/findings) alongside GSD PLAN/SUMMARY per phase.
