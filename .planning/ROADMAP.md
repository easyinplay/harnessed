## Active milestone: v8.0 Frictionless Entry

**Goal**: Turn the 2026-06-23 three-way re-comparison into the first of three competitive-gap milestones. v8.0 = the low-risk "quick wins" tier — a single-command resume entry (comet `/comet` analog; the mechanism already exists, only the zero-arg entry + ergonomics are missing) and a legible value-prop + <5min quickstart (comet's instantly-graspable positioning). The two big bets — **cross-harness reach (→ v9.0)** and **i18n surface (→ v10.0)** — are deferred to their own milestones per the scope decision below.

**Discuss decisions** (2026-06-23, via 3-way re-comparison + AskUserQuestion):
- **Posture = 守宽做深 (B)** — keep the heterogeneous-upstream-arbitration moat (capabilities.yaml + priority.yaml + ADR de-confliction); do NOT narrow to a single pairing like comet's OpenSpec×Superpowers.
- **Fact correction (verified 2026-06-23)** — the earlier "守宽 conflicts with cross-platform" premise was WRONG. gstack and ECC are already cross-harness (ECC README: "Works across Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini, Zed, GitHub Copilot"; gstack deploys to `.agents/.cursor/.factory/.hermes/.kiro/.omc/.openclaw/`). 守宽 and cross-platform are **synergistic** — upstreams already solved upstream-side portability. Cross-platform work collapses to abstracting harnessed's OWN hardcoded `~/.claude/` (`setup.ts:120/194` + state + inject) onto the industry `.agents/` + per-platform convention with auto-detect. No generator needed; no CC-degrade.
- **State-machine + evidence-guard are NOT gaps** (verified 2026-06-23) — harnessed already has a two-tier state machine (envelope 3-state activate/pause/complete in `state.ts` + ledger 5-state; `currentWorkflow.v1.ts:1` "state machine schema"; `nextStep.ts` mirrors `comet-state next`) and a fail-closed evidence guard (`checkpoint complete` → `checkArtifacts` + `checkPlanningSync`, BLOCKED unless `--force`). Earlier compare drafts mis-attributed these to comet; corrected.
- **Remaining real comet/Trellis gaps** = (1) cross-harness reach [→ v9.0], (2) single-command resume ergonomics [v8.0], (3) i18n skill surface [→ v10.0], (4) adoption/legibility [v8.0].
- **Milestone split** — quick-wins first (this v8.0), then cross-harness (v9.0) + i18n (v10.0) each as a dedicated milestone.

**Competitive basis** (do NOT re-create — one-fact-one-home): `.planning/research/01-competitive-landscape.md` … `04-failure-modes.md` + `SUMMARY.md` + `docs/comparison.md`. 2026-06-23 increment: comet 1,562 ★ / Trellis 10,949 ★; ECC v2.0.0 "Agent Harness Operating System" cross-harness; gstack 10-agent auto-detect.

**Invariants**: 守宽 moat preserved; KARPATHY-minimal surgical diffs; full gate green vs the 1335-test baseline; Windows CI green; biome preempt before every TS/JS commit; NEVER push without approval; every `.planning/` edit self-exemplifies v6.0 doc-discipline.

### Phases (sketch — refine at execution per anti-stale; do NOT pre-detail downstream)

- [ ] **Phase 24: single-command resume entry** — `harnessed` (zero-arg) = auto-detect the active workflow for cwd (`workflows.json[repoKey]`) + report current phase + continue (comet `/comet` analog). Mechanism exists (`resume.ts` + `nextStep.ts` + `workflows.json`); the gap is the zero-arg dispatch + ergonomics. Small, clear-value. Depends on: none.
- [ ] **Phase 25: value-prop + quickstart legibility** — README one-line positioning + install→first-workflow <5min quickstart, matching comet's graspable narrative. Docs-only. Depends on: Phase 24 (quickstart demos the resume entry).

### Adoption (non-phase follow-on)

Stars / demo gif / DeepWiki are marketing, not code-deliverables — tracked as a milestone follow-on, NOT a phase. ~0 ★ today vs comet 1.5k / Trellis 10.9k.

## Backlog / Deferred (future milestones)

- **v9.0 Cross-Harness** (big bet ①, un-defers the ex-v7.0 non-goal) — platform adapter: abstract harnessed's hardcoded `~/.claude/` (setup/state/inject) → platform descriptor; auto-detect installed harness; align the industry `.agents/` + per-platform dirs. Upstreams (gstack/ECC/superpowers/codegraph) already portable, so no generator / no upstream-mapping work. Opens with `/plan-eng-review` (structural). Sketch only — refine when started.
- **v10.0 i18n Surface** (big bet ②) — extend i18n from the CLI message layer (en/zh-Hans, already shipped) to the skill/workflow surface bilingual (comet model: ship EN+中文 skills). Parallelizable with v9.0. Sketch only.
- ~~Deferred non-goal (v7.0 discuss): cross-harness breadth~~ → **un-deferred 2026-06-23** (→ v9.0): demand changed (user direction 守宽做深 + cross-platform) AND feasibility changed (upstreams gstack/ECC verified already cross-harness). routing L2-LLM-supervisor simplification still deferred.
- Security hardening pass (threat-model-gated): shell-injection `security.ts`/`spawn.ts`/`path-guard.ts`; concurrency hazards `sigintTrap.ts`/`before-commit.ts`.
